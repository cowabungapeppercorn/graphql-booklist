# GraphQL - Booklist

This is a simple toy app I made to work with GraphQL on the server side in Node/Express and on the front end in React. It simply displays a list of books that are stored in a MongoDB server via Atlas. 

Follow the set up instructions below to install and run the application on your local device.

## Setup

To clone the repository, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/cowabungapeppercorn/graphql-booklist
```

Cd into the **server** folder and run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
The backend server will now be running. To see the graphiql interface, go to the following address in your browser:
```
http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

Cd back into the main folder and then into **client** and run:
```
npm start
npm run
```
You should now be directed to the application running in your browser at:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
